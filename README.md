# Unsupervised-Learning-CNN-KMeans-in-Python-on-Brain-Tumor-Dataset
Implementation of Unsupervised Learning CNN and K-Means in Python worked on Brain Tumor dataset.
I've divided the dataset into training and testing.
Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is used for image classification.
Kmeans is used to cluster the similar images.
The accuracy of image classification using CNN is 91%.
